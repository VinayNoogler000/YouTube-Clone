# YouTube Homepage Clone

## Project Description:

I, Vinay Tambey, have developed a clone of YouTube's home page by using only HTML and CSS technologies. This project was created to practice and improve my fundamental skills.

### Features:

- **CSS Flexbox and Grid:** Utilized to make the webpage responsive and enhance the user experience.
- **Navigation Bar:** Includes a logo and essential links.
- **Tags/Topics Bar:** Displays various tags/topics similar to YouTube's original design.
- **Sidebar:** Contains links to different sections.
- **Main Content Area:** A group of videos specifically arranged using CSS Grid to replicate YouTube's layout.

### Future Enhancements:

This project currently does not have any functionalities since it is built using HTML and CSS only. However, I plan to add functionality using JavaScript and React in the future to enhance and improve my frontend web development skills.
