# YouTube Home-Page Clone

I [Vinay Tambey] have developed a clone of YouTube's home page by using only HTML and CSS technologies. This project was built to practice and improve my fundamental skills. I leveraged CSS Flexbox and Grid efficiently to make the webpage responsive and enhance the user experience.

## Project Description:

This clone webpage includes the following components:
- **Navbar:** Contains the YouTube logo and other navigation elements.
- **Tags/Topics Bar:** Displays various tags and topics.
- **Sidebar:** Contains links to different sections, similar to the YouTube sidebar.
- **Main Content Area:** A group of videos, specifically arranged using CSS Grid.

I have added real data from multiple YouTube videos, including:
- Thumbnails
- Video Titles
- Channel Images
- Channel Names
- Upload Times
- View Counts

All icons on the webpage are added as SVG files in the form of `<img>` elements. I aimed to make the clone look exactly like the original YouTube homepage, striving for pixel-perfect accuracy.

### Future Enhancements:

Currently, this project is built using only HTML and CSS, so it does not include any functionalities. In the future, I plan to add functionality using JavaScript and React to further enhance and improve my frontend web development skills.
